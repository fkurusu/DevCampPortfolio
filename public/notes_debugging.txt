DEBUGGING

ByeBug
byebug gives us a working break point.

Right at the spot where byebug is called,  it creates a break point and the web server is hanging

def index
  @blogs = Blog.all
  byebug
end

It gives us a little terminal in the web server console

After finishing debugging just type:
continue

PRY
https://github.com/nixme/pry-debugger

Intall it in Rails, the Gemfile
gem 'pry-byebug'

To create a breakpoint use binding.pry

Use "continue" moves down to the next pry line
Use "next" to go to the next pry breakpoint in the code
Use 'g' and 'k' to navigate inside the pry console
Use 'q' or 'exit' to quite the pry console


ERROR MANAGEMENT

def divide(num1, num2)
  begin
    num1 / num2
  rescue => e
    puts "Error occurred: #{e}"
  end
end
